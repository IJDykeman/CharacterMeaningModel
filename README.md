![model diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IJDykeman/CharacterMeaningModel/master/model_diagram.svg)

This model attempts to predict any word's meaning based on its characters. It's implemented in tensorflow and uses the tflearn library.  See my blog post [here](http://ijdykeman.github.io/ml/2017/01/03/chars-to-vec.html) for details.
